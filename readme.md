  - [jump_portrait](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_portrait): Fetch JUMP images from CellPainting's AWS servers. It also contains some utilities to explore file names.
  - [jump_rr](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_rr): Generate browsable databases of perturbation similarities and morphological feature rankings to be explored and queried on a browser. 

### To be added
  - [copairs](https://github.com/broadinstitute/2023_12_JUMP_data_only_vignettes/tree/master):   - [copairs](https://github.com/cytomining/copairs): Find pairs and compute metrics between them.
