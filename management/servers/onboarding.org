#+title: Onboarding
This is documentation on how to onboard a new user to a NixOS server, replace  <machine_name> with the coloquial name of the machine you are setting up (e.g., moby is Al√°n's server).
Eventually we would want to automate the process, probably replacing many components with [[https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config][this]], as they provide scripts that automate the process as much as possible.

* Set up remote connections
** USER: Install [[https://tailscale.com/download][tailscale]]
Set up in the networtk that is associated to <machine_name>.
** homes/
- copy and adjust homes/<username>
** machines/<machine_name>/default.nix
Add the following, editing the =shell= line. The main options are
- zsh: quasi-standard terminal
- fish: nice autocompletion (non-posix compliant)
#+begin_src nix
  users.users.llanos = {
    shell = pkgs.zsh;
    isNormalUser = true;
    description = "User Name (e.g., Jane Doe)";
    extraGroups = [ "networkmanager" "wheel" "libvirtd" "qemu-libvirtd" "input"];
    openssh.authorizedKeys.keyFiles = [
      ../../homes/<username>/id_rsa.pub
    ];
  };
#+end_src

#+begin_src nix
Then enable home manager
  home-manager.users.llanos = {
    imports = [
     inputs.agenix.homeManagerModules.default
     ../../homes/llanos/<machine_name>.nix
    ];
  };
#+end_src

** Add the desired packages
For this new user the packages are to be added on =homes/<username>packages.nix=. Feel free to check [[https://github.com/afermg/clouds/tree/master/homes/amunoz/packages.nix#L5-L86][this]] section of the config for an example of the type of packages.

** USER: [[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent][Generate]] and copy the public ssh key to =home/<username>/id_rsa.pub= and then link it at =machines/<machine_name>/default.nix=.
** Apply new configuration
Move to the folder and run
#+begin_src shell
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<machine_name>
#+end_src

** Generate password
Generate password for new user

#+begin_src shell
sudo passwd <username>
#+end_src

** VS Code :optional:
The code related to vscode support is in the following sections. No modification should be needed if copying an existing profile.

*** On the client side
Follow [[https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-vscode-server?tab=readme-ov-file#connecting-with-ssh-timed-out][these]] instructions to be able to login from

    ../common/vscode.nix

* Setting up development environments
We use .envrc to login to reproducible development environments. From bash you normally just =cd= into the folder and it is set automatically. From a given IDE this may not be as simple:

** TODO Figure out how to do integrate .envrc on on VSCode and/or jupyter notebooks

** Example of Torch-compatible enviroment
A common (and tricky) dependency we use is pytorch. Here is an example of the standard . Note that the host NVIDIA driver must be 535 or 545 (installed here)

* Setting up development environments
* Day-to-day access
The environments can be accessed in multiple ways.
*** Jupyter notebook
This method requires =screen= both in remote and local computers.
**** Step 1: Open Jupyter notebook on Moby

#+begin_src shell
ssh $USER@moby
screen
cd project/folder
# envrc should start by itself here. If this project has not been configured that way you can do:
# nix develop . --impure
poetry run jupyter notebook
# Copy the url including the token
# Press <Ctrl-A> -> <Ctrl-D> to detatch your screen session
#+end_src

**** Step 2: Tunnel the port to your local computer
Then open a tunnel to your jupyter notebook instance from the local computer.
#+begin_src shell
screen -d -S tunnel -m 'ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 $USER@moby -N'
#+end_src

On your local computer, go yo the URL copied on step 1.

If moby is restarted you must repeat step 1 (we can try to automate it too).
If your local computer is restarted you need to repeat step 2.
*** VS Code
Tested on versions before 1.88.

1. Install Remote Development Extension
2.

*** Emacs
1. Set up your packages of interest ([[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][doom emacs]] makes it simpler for beginners). Make sure to include the direnv module.
2.Run
#+begin_src shell
ssh $user@moby -t 'emacsclient -t'

#+end_src
3. You may need to fiddle a bit to get the proper environment working, this is work in progress.
