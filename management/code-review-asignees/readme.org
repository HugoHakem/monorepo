#+title: Extract code-review assignees from github
#+PROPERTY: header-args :session base :results silent :async yes

We use this tool to keep our code reviews balanced across lab members.

** Installation
Install the dependencies
#+begin_src shell
poetry install --no-root
#+end_src

** Get Github data
It assumes poetry installation, but if you have the dependencies installed in a local environment you can run it without the "poetry run" prefix.

#+begin_src shell
poetry run github-to-sqlite pull-requests github.db broadinstitute/monorepo
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Now open the database in a new shell
#+begin_src shell
poetry run datasette github.db
#+end_src

** Access data
And then use a web browser to go to http://localhost:8001/github/pull_requests?_sort_desc=assignee&_facet=assignees.

This shows a table with the information of pull requests. The columns we care about. The facet set indicates the username of the contributor and the number of pull requests in which they are involved.

** Remote usage
If you are running this on a remote server you can forward the port by running this on the local machine:
#+begin_src shell :tangle no
ssh -L 8001:localhost:8001 user@remote -N
#+end_src
